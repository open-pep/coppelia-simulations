Video presents following scenarios.

## Egoistic, two rats 

The video depicts a situation in which shortly after starting a patrol, both robots spot the same rat and start chasing it. Meanwhile, the second rat destroys the grain located in the middle of the arena. After neutralizing the first rat, one of the robots begins chasing the second pest.

 

## Empathic, two rats

In the footage, the robot on the right spots a rat and signals it with an LED strip. The second robot, noticing this, continues to patrol the surroundings in search of other pests. After a while, it detects the second rat and starts following it. As a result, both rats are neutralized and grain loss is reduced.

 

## Egoistic, robots run out of battery

The video shows the behavior of robots that detect the same rat. During the chase, the robots interfere with each other, making it difficult to follow and neutralize the rat. Eventually, the rat is neutralized, but before the robots can spot and begin their pursuit of the other pest, both of them run out of battery and the second rat escapes.

 

## Empathic, low battery help

In the video, the robot on the right starts chasing the detected rat. During this action, the agent signals with an LED strip that it needs assistance, due to a low battery level. The other robot notices this and decides to help to catch the weaker rat. After neutralizing it, the second robot starts searching for other pests.
